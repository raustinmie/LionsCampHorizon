			<h3>Adventure Camp Prerequisites</h3>
			<p className="cs-text">
				Campers new to Lions Camp Horizon must first complete a Base Camp
				session before being considered for Adventure Camp. This gives us the
				opportunity to assess the applicant’s ability to safely and successfully
				participate in off-site activities that are at a faster-pace and are
				more physically challenging. Staff to camper ratios are 1:4 or 1:5 and
				other conditions apply. To discuss registration for Adventure Camp,
				please email us at acd@lionscamphorizon.org and one of our Admission
				Team members will be in touch as soon as possible.
			</p>
			<h3>Discharges</h3>
			<p className="cs-text">
				We reserve the right to dismiss any individual from participation in
				program activities if staff determines medical conditions or behaviors
				exhibited by the camper pose harm to himself/herself or others.
				Considerable discussion and deliberation takes place before an
				individual is dismissed and the parent, guardian or designated emergency
				contact must remove the individual from the campus upon our request.
			</p>
			<p className="cs-text">
				Depending on the reason the camper was discharged, dismissal does not
				necessarily deny the individual admission to future camp programs.
				However, an in-person interview with the camper, the parent/guardian and
				other service providers will be required as part of the future
				application process.
			</p>
			<strong>
				The staff and Board of Directors reserve the right to refuse or cancel
				enrollment of an individual if we don’t believe we can accommodate the
				needs of the camper, or, if they pose a risk to himself/herself or
				others.
			</strong>
